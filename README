Repository Updater
==================

A simple script to keep a repository with submodules up to date
 with the latest changes within each submodule.  Currently defaults
 to a simple commit message and everything works off of the master
 branch.  See secrets.example for required variables.

Requires the following to run:
 - secrets.txt with appropriate configuration
 - openssh private key
   - generate using ssh-keygen
   - ex. ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "my username message" -f my_keyname.id_rsa
